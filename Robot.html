						<h2>Ocean Networks Canada Autonomous Robot</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="row 150%">
						<p>As a first-year engineering project commissioned by Ocean Networks Canada, I was tasked with creating a robot designed to simulate the automated functionality that would be necessary to expand and connect ONC’s Vancouver-Island wide observation network. Alongside the environmental research opportunities afforded by the system’s many observation nodes, the project expanded and improved BC’s earthquake and tsunami early warning system. </p>
						<p>The robot performed in a simulated 2m x 2m arena and was designed using using VEX robotics equipment and RobotC. The robot was to detect and approach an infrared beacon (see below), attaching a self-made connector to the beacon’s target receiver to simulate a cable connection. Although the task was simple in principle, concerns regarding tolerances and edge cases associated with infrared readings (sunlight caused many problems) proved to complicate the project greatly. </p>
						<p>I programmed the robot entirely from scratch, and used the opportunity to first understand the benefits of machine learning, since nearly all its decision making was based on conditional statements. The code, which can be found on my GitHub, was a conditional Finite State Machine that performed well in testing and successfully attached to the target beacon during final trails. </p>
