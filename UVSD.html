						<h2>UVic Satellite Design Club</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="row 150%">
						<p>I joined UVic Satellite Design in September 2017 as a member of the Onboard Computer (OBC) team. I spent the entire semester learning the use of FreeRTOS, the kernel used for the satellite’s operating system, and Satellite Toolkit (STK), a space simulator used to produce orbital data for stress testing. </p>
						<p>In January 2018 I became the OBC software lead for the Homathko satellite, taking over from the UVSD’s past Co-op student. Our current project, Homathko, is the UVSD’s entry to the Canadian Satellite Design Competition (CSDC) that will conclude in June 2018 with shake table testing at the David Florida Lab in Ottawa. The satellite has two major payloads consisting of laser system, designed to monitor the impact of atmospheric disturbances on dark energy waves and a radio repeater, created to contribute to the pre-existing network of amateur radio repeater satellites. To learn more about the project and our club, please visit www.uvsd.ca. </p>
						<p>The software team is responsible for the “brains” of the satellite: we design the operating system and the interfaces that are used to interact with the physical systems on Homathko. The OBC schedules its tasks to prioritize mission-critical tasks, polling external sensors, firing the payload, and reacting to events in real time. </p>
						<p>To date, this has been both the most difficult and rewarding software project that I’ve participated in. It’s required rapid learning of the hardware and software framework behind the Homathko OBC through active questioning and research, and has developed my leadership and project management skills as I plan and organize that work done by our 6-person software team. I plan to participate as a member of the UVSD until graduation, and want to pursue a Co-op through the club as my final work term at UVic.</p>
